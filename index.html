                HTML, or <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually
                have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list. At the top of your document, you need to
                tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions
                of the language. You tell the browser this information by adding the !DOCTYPE tag on the first line, where the ... part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use !DOCTYPE html. The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for
                older browsers. The html is not case sensitive. Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening html tag goes directly below the !DOCTYPE html tag line, and the closing. Add a DOCTYPE tag for HTML5 to the
                top of the blank HTML document in the code editor. Under it, add opening and closing html tags, which wrap around an h1 element. The heading can include any text.
            </p>

            <h2>HTML is amazing</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others. These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
                and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and Iother developers find the main content of your page. You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements.
                Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag. Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically
                go inside the head element. Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome. Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder
                text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.
